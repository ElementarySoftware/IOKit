### App Store will reject it ❗️
### Gain user-space access to hardware devices and drivers.

Hello,

This IOKit comes from the Mac OS project. I have made a few changes to the iOS project to compile and use it. So I don't know much about IOKit. 

This is the official IOKit documentation:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/iokit.
Maybe it can give you some help.Https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice
